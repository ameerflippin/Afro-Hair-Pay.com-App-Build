# AfroHairPay.com

Urban Public Finance a new seed stage startup is launching an enterprise build of a new mobile app, “Afro Hair Pay.com,” in the “Buy Now Pay Later” Payments Sector for the hair care industry.
Our goal is to create an alliance with tech & telecom global decision-makers in hopes of having a global launch over a 1 to 2 year time period, while creating an opportunity for emerging software developers to work closely with top software development firms. The goal is to work with app developers at all levels in numerous disciplines in hopes of producing an open architecture environment for developers around the new app.
Any development concepts should initially be modelled similarly to the Afterpay.com success story with a lending and payment component. Any opportunity to work with you in pulling together a team of emerging software developers globally in urban communities is highly appreciated.

This project is in the early Discovery Stages searching for code to reach the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage for an eventual launch in the Google Play Store followed by a global rollout over a 2-year period. This is a paid project.
